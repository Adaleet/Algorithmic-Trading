# Algorithmic Trading System in Python
This project is currently in progress, and is a comprehensive algorithmic trading system built in Python. It allows you to collect financial data, preprocess it, implement trading strategies, backtest them, and execute trades in real-time with a broker's API. The system is modular, enabling you to customize and expand it as needed. The collected data based on the user's input will generate a visual model for further comprehension and analysis.
